The plot_circle function takes three parameters: center_x and center_y specify the coordinates of the center of the circle, and radius specifies the radius of the circle.
Inside the function, the algorithm initializes x to the radius, y to 0, and calculates the initial value of the decision parameter pk.
The points list is initialized to store the coordinates of the points that make up the circle.
The algorithm enters a loop that continues until x becomes less than y.
In each iteration of the loop, the algorithm adds eight symmetric points to the points list by adding or subtracting x and y values from the center coordinates.
The algorithm then updates the y value by incrementing it by 1.
If the decision parameter pk is greater than 0, the algorithm updates the x value by decrementing it by 1 and adjusts the value of pk.
If the decision parameter pk is not greater than 0, the algorithm adjusts the value of pk.
After the loop ends, the points list contains all the coordinates of the points that form the circle.
The x_points and y_points variables are created by unpacking the points list into separate lists of x and y coordinates.
The plt.scatter function is used to plot the points on the graph. The marker='s' argument specifies that square markers should be used, and the color='b' argument sets the color of the markers to blue.
The plt.gca().set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box') line ensures that the aspect ratio of the graph is equal, so the circle is not distorted.
Finally, the plt.show() function is called to display the plot.
In your specific example, plot_circle(0, 0, 10) is called to plot a circle with a center at coordinates (0, 0) and a radius of 10.

The resulting plot will show the circle centered at (0, 0) with square markers representing the points on the circumference of the circle.
